# Version 4.0.3

### Features
- Hands-free experience is now added to the voice-to-voice mode. When the option is turned on, the microphone is automatically enabled once the answer read out is done.

### Fixes
- Fixed an issue that caused reading out persistent options twice in voice-to-voice mode.
- When customizing the chat look and feel, multiple `SendUIConfig` instances were reachable from the `ChatUIProvider`. We simplified it to have a single one that is reachable under `ChatUIProvider.chatInputUIProvider.sendCmpUIProvider.uiConfig`.   

  > #### Usage of ‘ChatAutocompleteUIConfig.sendUIConfig’ was deprecated.
  
### ChatController API
- `ChatLoadedListener` can be provided also after ChatController creation, for following chat start/restore operations.

### Known issue
- Ticket typed channel is not supported on devices with API level lower than 19

# Version 4.0.2

Fixed on this version:

- **Voice to voice:** response readout is activated on voice recorded requests only.

- **Full article display**: Displayed content and title matches opened article, also on postback responses.

- Prevent images and video images from being cut, on wide devices resolutions.

# Version 4.0.1

In this version:

### Bot related
- **UserId management** - The SDK generates a userId via BE API, on Bot chat creation,   if one was not provided by the embedding App.   
  In order to identify chats sessions as belong to the same user in the reporting, the same userId should be used. Newly generated userId is available to the embedding App, via `AccountInfoProvider.update` implementation. 
```diff
- Breaking Changes
```
> - The Embedding App is responsible to **save the userId**, once created, and **provide it on `BotAccount.userId`** for successive chats creation of the same account. 

- **Multi answer design** - Bot responses which contains multiple answers of kind `inlineChoice`, are displayed as persistent options. Meaning the options are not disappears when one is selected.

### Fixes
- Improve SDK allocated resources release.
- Fix active links on bot responses, while escalated live chat is in progress.

# Version 4.0.0

In this version:

### Voice to voice
- An extension feature to the speech recognition, Text to speech, responses to recorded requests can be read to the user.
- Configurable TTS engine
- Embedding app can alternate the text before it is read to the user.
- Voice support level is configurable on ConversationSettings

### Messaging chat
> If you are interested of the Messaging capabilities of the Mobile SDK please reach out to your Customer Success Manager

### TLSv1.2 protocol support
- SDK supports TLSv1.2 secured connections on lower API level devices (< 21)

##

#### Improvements
- ChatController
  - ChatController can now be used to create multiple chats, no need to re-instantiate.
  - Chats end is generated by one of the chatting parties: user, live-agent, or by the embedding app. Chats are no longer being closed automatically.
  - New APIs and properties:</u>
    - `onChatInterruption` - notify the SDK when something was activated on the device that may interrupt the regular chat flow, like incoming/outgoing calls.   
    - `destruct` - The ChatController instance will clear all its resources and active chats.
    - `wasDestructed` - Indicates if ChatController was destructed and can no longer be used.
    - `terminateChat` - Ends **all** current open chats.
    - `endChat` - Ends only active open chat.
    - `startChat` - start a new chat with account, with the same ChatController instance.   
    - `restoreChat` - Continue open chat even if the chat UI was removed. Also can be used when the chat fragment is restored by the app, and to start new chats.
    - `HandoverHandler` - Handover handler can be set to the ChatController instance at any time.

#### Fixes
- Bot - articles parsing.
- Bot - Welcome message request doesn't increases the engagements and interactions counters.

#### Changes and Deprecations

```diff
- Breaking Changes   
```
- <u>Handover</u> - Chat elements related events are not passed automatically to the `ChatElementListener` implementations. Best practice: extend the abstract HandoverHandler class and use its base class injection methods.
- SDK doesn't ends chats automatically anymore. Chat can be ended by user, live agent or the embedding App. ChatController destruction doesn't ends the chats, only releases their resources. [see ChatController new APIs](#improvements)
- ErrorCodes definition was relocated to package "com.integration.core.annotations"
- `DrawablePosition` was removed, since it was a duplicate of `CompoundDrawableLocation`

```diff
- Deprecations
```
> All deprecations replacements and comments are available via javaDoc/KDOC (Android studio quick help)
- Configuring voice support on `ConversationSettings` and `ChatInpuData` replaced with VoiceSettings
- SessionInfo.update - overrides only properties with the same key (use override method for a complete replacement)
- Live session properties, such as, ChatId, Department, applicationId, replaced with the identical properties located on `com.integration.core.LiveSession` 
- Elements injection methods on ChatDelegate were deprecated. 
- `ChatInputData.textInputHint` replaced with `ChatInputData.inputHints`
- Constructor deprecation on ContentChatElement class hierarchy.
- `VisitorDataKeys` were deprecated and replaced with `SessionInfoKeys`
- `ChatbarCmpConfig` - _drawableLocation_  and _compoundDrawablesPadding_ were deprecated and replaced with _ChatbarCmpConfig.drawableConfig_, which include them both.

```diff
+ Known issues
```
- Bot - Articles with iframe tag for **embedded videos**, should not contain empty properties, such as `allowfullscreen`. Every property should have a value set to it.
